## Thanks for visiting [Peak Project](https://peak-project.herokuapp.com/), a [Mountain Project](mountainproject.com) clone.

### This is a website meant to provide community created information on rock, ice, and snow climbs around the world.

### This site was made using PostreSQL/Sequelize and Express for the backend server, as well as React, Redux and Material UI for the frontend.

### Users can:
* Browse already created routes and areas
* Create and edit their own climbs.

### Climbs are organized by:
* A parent area containing the immediately adjacent climbs.
* Optional super-areas containing many sub-areas
* The state in which they reside, or various international regions

###  Features to be added:
* A user profile page containing personal info, to-dos, and a tick list
* Further development of the Area and State pages to provide more information and customization
* Add photos and comments to route profiles
* Add the ability to upload images via Amazon web services
